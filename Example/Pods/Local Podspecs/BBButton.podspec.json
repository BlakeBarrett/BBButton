  "description": "if you've ever done any programmatic UI in UIKit, I'm sure you've encountered a scenario where you want to programmatically add a click listener to a UIControl.\nI'm willing to bet that the thought has occurred to you, \"There _must_ be an easier way.\"; especially if you have ever added an `OnClickListener` to a `Button` in Android.\nThis enables you to add a click listener by passing a closure to a new `onClick()` function. \nThis is definitely for convenience only, but I'm glad to use it.",
